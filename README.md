# ESP8266 AP Wifi Config to EEPROM for Arduino

It's a fully-featured `Arduino library` for `ESP8266` which initiate and write WIFI configurations to *EEPROM* through a self-serving Web.

> The idea and some code parts are from https://github.com/nikant/espWiFi2eeprom.

## Features
It will try to connect to the AP by the configurations written in EEPROM automatically.

Once the connection failed, it will start a new AP(host of WiFi) and provide a `web interface` for the configurations.

**optional**
A web service can be enabled to provide information page, restart & reset functions.
